_Demo Gif will take a second to load_

To run the project just open index.html in your browser with javascript enabled :)

# Project 5 specifics

I did not alter the html or css, only the ./js/scripts.js file.

To review the project just open index.html in your browser.

Basic Spec:

✅ Gallery

- Get and display 12 random users using mockup design

- Create a modal window with close feature

Exceeds Grade:

✅ Search function

- I used .filter method to implement search.

✅ Modal toggle

- Even works after filtering!
